# EDM-RL: Toward Stable Reinforcement Learning through Evolutionary Algorithms

## Abstract

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has experienced tremendous growth in the past few years. However, training stability of agents continues to be an open research question. Here, the authors present Ensembled Directed Mutation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (EDM-DRL) - a hybridization of evolutionary computing (EC), ensemble learning, and DRL methods as a means of mitigating training instability in DRL agents. We show that our method trains more consistently than DRL baselines alone. We also show that by employing our novel mutation and ensemble methods, performance of DRL agents can be improved during test time without sacrificing training stability. Further, though a similar number of time steps are used, we show that the EDM-DRL algorithm uses a mere 1% or less of the network parameter updates used in Advantage Actor Critic (A2C). Finally, we conduct an ablation study to identify components within the EDM-DRL algorithm responsible for highest contribution.

## Results

The graphs which correspond to the results of this work are documented below.

As shown, though the A2C algorithm is able to solve the environment faster on average, the EDM-DRL method 
is able to solve the environment with a tighter standard deviation than the A2C baseline.

This demonstrates that the weight voting mechanism is able to out perform the 1-elite strategy. In
constrast, the softmax ensemble approach does not surpass the 1-elite strategy in final performance.

Here we see that the ablations of various mutation and recombination methods do not have significant
effect on the final performance or stability of agents during training. In particular, the mean
recombination strategy has high overlap with the unmodified base agent.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7
* Libraries
  * numpy
  * gym
  * matplotlib
  * scipy
  * torch

## Usage

### Analysis Scripts

* visualize_all.py [folder or file] [--f Enables scan of whole folder]
  * Example: "visualize_all.py results/experiment_1_baseline --f"
  * The primary visualization of the images shown above. Takes all the experiments in the folder and plots the STDs and means of the runs.

* visualize_runs.py [file]
  * Example: "visualize_runs.py results/experiment_1_baseline/baselineA2C.p"
  * Plots each individual run in an experiment.

* visualize_ablation [results/experiment_3_ablation]
  * Creates the ablation graphs. Only works on the ablation folder.

* compare_stat_sig.py [folder] [--f, Required]
  * Example: "compare_stat_sig.py results/experiment_1_baseline --f"
  * runs a permutation of the all the experiments in the folder, comparing each using the defined statistical method.

### Tuning

* hparam_search.py [config file]
  * Example: "hparam_search.py configs/experiment_2_ensemble/earl_cart_strat_weightedvote.json"
  * Runs random search on specified config. This requires significant configuration fo the hparam_search file so usage is not recommended.
